# JavaFX Database Final Project

This project connects to a database and allows users to view the names in the database 1 by 1. <br />
It also allows the users to add or delete names from the database's list. <br />
Another function of this program is to allow users to determine the background colors via a color picker. <br />
There is also a function to make an image appear or disappear and the text on the button responds appropriately. <br />

This was created for COP 3003 as a year end project.
