# Project Title

This project connects to a database and allows users to view the names in the database 1 by 1. <br />
It also allows the users to add or delete names from the database's list. <br />
Another function of this program is to allow users to determine the background colors via a color picker. <br />
There is also a function to make an image appear or disappear and the text on the button responds appropriately. <br />

This was created for COP 3003 as a year end project.

## Documentation

Create a docs folder in your project. Generate JavaDoc in your IDE. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
